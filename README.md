# starship-config

Starship Cross-Shell Prompt is quite popular as I see them in every Tech Youtuber's video. I decided to move to Starship from p10k as I like the configurability of Starship. On the other hand, I also like the style of p10k quite a lot. So I configured a p10k-like starship theme.

This would be how it looks in a GitHub repo:

This is how it would look like in a regular directory:
